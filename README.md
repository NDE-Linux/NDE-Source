# NDE Source

NDE Source is the main Repository that contains the source code for NDE, please use this repository with carefullness and some bugs can lead to large errors in NDE.

If you're looking for other projects built-in to NDE, you can see them in our GitLab Instance, [here.](https://gitlab.com/ndelinux/)

# NDE Window Manager

The NDE Window Manager is the default window manager that comes with Linux Distributions using the NDE Desktop Enviroment. The NDE Window Manager consists of 2 main components, a titlebar, Window Manager buttons.

In NDE, the window manager buttons consists of 3 shapes, including:

- Circle (This button is used to close app windows in NDE.)
- Triangle (This button is used to minimise app windows in NDE.)
- Square (This button is used to make app windows to fullscreen mode in NDE.)

*Note: The "sample.c" file has been created to test what a sample window manager for NDE could be, you can also use it to get inspiration for the official NDE window manager code.* 

Because we have insufficent resources to develop our own Window Manager system for NDE, we have decided to use GNOME's Mutter Window Manager system for the time being. 

# JDK and JVM for NDE

The main directory for JDK and JVM in the NDE Source repository has been deleted since there are errors with GitHub, not allowing you to upload a huge file that cant be split in half, and errors with GitHub Desktop, disconnecting the remote anytime you Push to origin.

Instead th JDK and JVM for NDE will be hosted on our GitLab Group. We will update this README when it's ready.
